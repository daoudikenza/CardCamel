  CardCamel is a terminal-based flashcard study app built for efficient, command-line learning. 
  It empowers users to create, review, and organize flashcards with ease, keeping the study process 
  focused and distraction-free. Users can add new flashcards by entering question-answer pairs, 
  categorize them into custom decks, and access a variety of interactive features including randomized quizzes, 
  a Match game, and a Gravity game for dynamic learning sessions.

  CardCamel tracks progress by logging correct and incorrect answers, allowing users to revisit 
  challenging cards and monitor their improvement over time. With an intuitive text-based interface, 
  users interact seamlessly through simple commands to add, organize, and study cards, making it
  easy to maintain a study rhythm. The app also includes features to edit and delete flashcards, 
  import flashcard sets from CSV files, and view detailed progress reports.
